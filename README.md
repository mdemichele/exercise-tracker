# exercise-tracker
A MERN stack web application to keep track of exercises. Built for CS 290 - Web Development 

The app is comprised of essentially two apps: a react front-end application and an express back-end REST api. 

To use the project on your local machine, you can clone the repository. Then, use the command in both the demichem_react and demichem_rest directories:

`npm install`

Once you've installed all the dependencies. You can run both applications in development mode by using the command in both directories:

`npm start`

The react application will run on localhost:8000 and the express api will run on localhost:3000. 

# Concepts Learned
